# Koding Global Virtual Hackathon's Submission

## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](/images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)

We had the idea to create some kind of an application to make learning programming social, efficient and fun. We have chosen to create a system where you will learn and practice programming by solving little challenges that will get progressively more difficult and will require more effort and research.
This way, people will have a fun way to enhance their programming level. We believe that this approach will encourage people to think how they can solve the problem, and also how they can find the information that will help them solve it.
This reflects real life programming much more, then just following a tutorial.
Another important aspect of this application is that each submitted solution has to be reviewed by another member of the application. In other words, when you submit your solution to a challenge, a user who has accumulated sufficiant points will look at your solution and will mark it either as correct or incorrect.
He will also be able to leave you a comment with suggestions and tips.

By solving the puzzles you will earn points and start your journey up the leader board. Other people can vote your solution up or down and you will be able to create your own challenges when you gain more experience too. 

Some of the functions:
-Solve programming challenges
-Receive feedback with tips and advice
-Discuss challenges and solutions with other users
-Review submitted solutions
